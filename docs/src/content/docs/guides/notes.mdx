### Hosting
Host must be the local IP of your network, in case you use a host that provides you with a url, you must set as host 0.0.0.0.0, and if you want to use a local machine on your internet network you should consult your provider, a technician or use port forwarding.

## Future implementations
In the future we plan to add the following features:
1. Make the server serve as a local client, i.e., to serve as [ezdb](https://vimnlabs.github.io/ezdb/) by itself.
2. Add all functions that are in [ezdb](https://vimnlabs.github.io/ezdb/)
