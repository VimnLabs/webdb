```ts copy wrap twoslash showLineNumbers
/** This must be a unique secret string, use env variables */
const AUTH_KEY = process.env['AUTH'] as string
/** This must be the url of your database, either the IP or the URL given by the host, try to add the protocol (http or https). Also avoid ending with /*/
const HOST = process.env['HOST'] as string
// ---cut---
import { DatabaseClient } from "@vimn/webdb"

const Client = new DatabaseClient({
  auth: AUTH_KEY,
  host: HOST,
  port: 80
});
```

The code you see here starts an instance of the client, which works to facilitate accesses, I will explain each part of the configuration below:

1. <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0"> Auth: </h4> <p style="margin-top: 0">This is the authentication key, it is used to verify that the request is valid and must be **identical** to the server.</p>
2. <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0"> Host: </h4>
<p style="margin-top: 0">This is the url to which the requests will be made, it must be complete, that is to say, it must include the protocol and the domain. Ex: http://localhost</p>
<Aside type="caution">Avoid ending the url with “/”.</Aside>
3. <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0"> Port: </h4> <p style="margin-top: 0">This is the port to which the requests will be made.</p>
